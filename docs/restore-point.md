- ❌ Admin CMS dashboard
- ❌ Database schema and RLS policies
- ❌ Authentication system
- ❌ Dynamic content from database
- ❌ Repository pattern implementation
- ❌ Email integration (Resend)

```

### How to Restore
1. Checkout this commit: `git checkout <commit-hash>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
4. App should run on `http://localhost:8080` with full template intact

### Notes
- This baseline is **fully functional** as a static marketing site
- All content is hardcoded in components (no CMS)
- No authentication or user accounts
- No database connectivity
- Ready for Phase 1 backend integration

## Restore Point #2: Documentation & Architecture Foundation

**Date:** 2025-10-03  
**Phase:** Phase 0 - Documentation Complete  
**Commit Hash:** (To be recorded)

### Description
Complete documentation structure created with PRD, task breakdown, backend schema, architecture patterns, deployment plan, and content mapping. Foundation for migration-ready development established.

### What's Added
- ✅ `/docs/PRD.md` - Complete Product Requirements Document
- ✅ `/docs/tasks.md` - Phased task breakdown with checklists
- ✅ `/docs/backend.md` - Database schema, RLS policies, storage buckets
- ✅ `/docs/architecture.md` - Ports/adapters pattern, repository interfaces, DTOs
- ✅ `/docs/restore-point.md` - This file (version tracking)
- ✅ `/docs/changelog.md` - Change tracking initialized
- ✅ `/docs/deployment.md` - Deployment strategy (Vercel + Hostinger)
- ✅ `/docs/content-mapping.md` - Devmart content mapping to Digtek template

### Decisions Applied
- **Pricing Page:** Included in Phase 1
- **Analytics:** Plausible (privacy-focused)
- **Email:** Resend (modern, developer-friendly)
- **Content:** Seed with placeholder Devmart content

### Architecture Defined
- **Pattern:** Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture)
- **Layers:** UI → Services → Repositories → Adapters → Providers
- **Abstraction:** All external providers accessed via interfaces (migration-ready)
- **Validation:** Zod schemas for all DTOs
- **Testing:** Mock adapters for testing/dev

### Next Steps
- Phase 1: Enable Lovable Cloud (Supabase)
- Create repository folder structure (`src/lib/`)
- Implement database schema and RLS policies
- Build authentication system
- Start admin CMS shell

### How to Restore
Same as Restore Point #1, plus:
- Review `/docs/` folder for complete project context
- Follow `/docs/tasks.md` for implementation order

## Rollback Procedure

If you need to revert to a previous restore point:

1. **Identify the restore point commit hash** from this document
2. **Create a backup branch** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   ```
3. **Checkout the restore point commit**:
   ```bash
   git checkout <commit-hash>
   ```
4. **Create a new branch from the restore point**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b restore-point-X
   ```
5. **Reinstall dependencies** (if package.json changed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
6. **Test the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
7. **If satisfied, merge to main** (or continue development from this point)

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always commit at restore points** with clear commit messages
2. **Tag restore points in Git**: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Baseline Template"`
3. **Test thoroughly before creating a restore point**
4. **Document any known issues** at each restore point
5. **Update this file immediately** after creating a new restore point
